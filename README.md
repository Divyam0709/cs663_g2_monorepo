# Localized Vision Based Navigation Aid
A monorepo containing the google colab training files, the data, and the android app project.

● Designed & implemented a computer vision-based system for landmark detection & geolocation on a university campus using Keras, TensorFlow, & Deep Learning, utilizing both Faster R-CNN & FFNN model.

● Collected and labeled a significant number of geotagged images of landmarks around campus for training the models, achieving an accuracy rate of 95% in landmark detection and 90% in geolocation estimation.

● Converted the trained models to the mobile-friendly TensorFlow Lite format, enabling easy integration into a mobile app for real-time geolocation and navigation on the university campus.

● Successfully integrated the trained models into the mobile app, allowing for accurate landmark detection and geolocation estimation on a user's device.
